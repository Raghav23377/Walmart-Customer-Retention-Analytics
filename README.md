# Walmart-Customer-Retention-Analytics
Walmart Customer Retention Analytics project focuses on analyzing customer behavior, identifying churn patterns, and providing actionable insights to help improve customer engagement and  loyalty. This Project applies end-to-end data analysis techniques, including data cleaning, modeling, visualization, and business insight generation.
The project begins with extensive data preparation using Power Query. Multiple data tables, including customer profiles, transaction history, product details, promotions, and store information, were cleaned, transformed, and merged into a reliable analytical dataset. Missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies were resolved to ensure accuracy and trustworthiness in reporting. A strong data model was built with appropriate relationships to support advanced calculations and dynamic reporting.

Key business metrics were developed using DAX measures, such as Churn Rate, Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), Average Order Value, Repeat Purchase Rate, Customer Retention Rate, Promotion Impact, and Revenue Contribution. Additional calculated columns were created for customer segmentation, frequency grouping, loyalty classification, and cohort analysis, enabling deeper insights into customer behavior across different periods and store types.

The final Power BI report consists of multiple interactive pages, each designed to highlight different aspects of customer retention. The dashboard includes KPI cards, bar charts, line graphs, donut charts, matrices, heatmaps, and drill-through pages. These visuals help stakeholders easily identify trends such as declining customer segments, high-value customers, retention performance by store type, and the effectiveness of loyalty programs and promotions.

The insights gained from the report help Walmart understand critical patterns such as which customer groups are at higher risk of churn, the factors contributing to customer drop-off, and the elements that encourage repeat purchases. The dashboard provides actionable recommendations related to targeted promotions, personalized engagement, and optimized loyalty strategies.

Overall, this project demonstrates strong skills in Power BI, including Power Query, DAX, data modeling, and dashboard design. It effectively translates raw data into meaningful insights, supporting data-driven decision-making to enhance Walmart’s customer retention and business performance.
